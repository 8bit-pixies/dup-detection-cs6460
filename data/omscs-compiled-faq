"What is this ""foundational course requirement""?","All new students must pass TWO foundational courses (see #4) with a B grade or better in the first year of the program. Additionally, you can only take foundational courses until this requirement is met. This means one Fall, one Spring, and one Summer session. Example: Starting in Spring 2017 would mean you have Spring 2017, Summer 2017, and Fall 2017 to complete this requirement.

Where can I see the syllabus/reading/pre-reqs for Course X before I sign up?,"
There are a couple places for this.

First, check the course's specific page on the [Current Courses](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/current-courses) section of the website. Many list syllabi, pre-reqs, etc.

Second, go to [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/courses/georgia-tech-masters-in-cs) and see if the course is offered for free there. If so, you can register using a Google or Facebook account to view a lot of the lecture material for free before the course begins to see if it is for you or even to get a slight jump.

Third, here's a fantastic [Pre-Req Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JUbZK1xEyvSQEhDEi3vqGDgnVQCi0nR9nOIzDGxJO2I/edit#gid=0) linked to on the Google Plus community.

When are courses offered? How long are they?,"Courses are offered in the Fall, Spring, and Summer terms. In the Fall and Spring, the term lasts 15 weeks. In the Summer, they can be anywhere from 10-13 weeks.",reddit
How many courses are required to graduate?,"30 hours must be completed to graduate. 15-18 hours will come from your specialization field, and the rest should be filled in using elective courses (anything offered by the program).",reddit
Can I select multiple specializations?,"In a sense, no. You can only have one specialization for graduation purposes. However, you're more than welcome to take all the courses and ""complete"" another specialization. It just won't count as a second specialization. In the end, no specializations are listed on your diploma.",reddit
Help! Machine Learning doesn't have enough electives for the specialization!,"There are lots of courses being added over time that will likely go into that category. It has been confirmed that CSE-8803 Big Data for Health Informatics and CS-8803-O03 Special Topics: Reinforcement Learning will be added to the list as possibilities.

"My specialization courses don't add up to 30 hours, but isn't that the program requirement?","Yes, it is. The Interactive Intelligence, Robotics, and Machine Learning specializations all require 15 hours, and Computing Systems requires 18. The remaining hours to meet the 30 hours requirement can be from any other courses in the program. Remember, 6 hours must foundational, whether in the specialization or not.",reddit

How does registration work for new students?,"You will be issued a time ticket usually about ten days before classes start that tells you when to log in and register. There will be an email usually a few days before time tickets are assigned that explains the process in excruciating detail. To see when time tickets will be issued, check out the [Academic Calendar](http://www.registrar.gatech.edu/calendar/).",reddit
Will I be able to get into Course X?,"The default answer is maybe. Most of the popular courses will have a long waitlist by the time new students are able to register. Have a few backups (2-4) ready just in case the course(s) you want have huge waitlists. You can add yourself to the waitlist for a course if you're determined to take it, however.",reddit
"I'm on a waitlist, but I'm number ### on it! I'm not going to get into any courses!","First, relax. You will get into at least one course, so don't worry about that. Second, the waitlists are used to gauge how many TAs are necessary for a particular section before they allocate the seats. So, if all 200-300 seats in a popular course are taken, do not worry about being on the waitlist. Many times, they will open up a lot more seats for the most popular courses to clear out a bunch of the waitlist. This may not happen until the first week of classes, but many professors take things slow the first week in anticipation of their course rosters fluctuating.

Also, your waitlist position will likely go down (closer to 1) as time goes by. Many students register for courses and then change their mind after the first couple days, or they simply overloaded on courses (chose more than the allowed number) and will drop some as the first day of classes approaches.",reddit

Can someone read my Personal Statement/Resume/Etc.?,"Sure, just remember that no one here has the magic answer to getting admitted. We can do our best to give some feedback, though.",reddit
Can I delay my admission to the following term if I've already been accepted?,"Unfortunately, no. You will have to reapply again for the new term.",reddit
Can I repeat a course? Will it still count?,"You can repeat a course as many times as you would like. However, all attempts will count towards your GPA and only the last attempt will count towards the degree.",reddit
What if I want to take a semester off for some reason?,"You simply don't register for any courses in that semester. However, any TWO consecutive semesters without courses will remove you from the program. Example: You took a course in the Fall and want a break in the Spring. If you don't sign up for a course in the Summer, you will be dropped.",reddit

When should you declare your specialization?," As of September the official word is as follows: ""We will give you
information about declaring your area of specialization at a later date. It is
not necessary for you to declare at this time.""

**Sometimes students are asked to tell their intended specializations just for planning of future offerings, but You don't ""have to"" declare until you petition to graduate. Before then, you can change your mind as many times as you like because more than half of your courses will be only counted as elective anyways (need 30 course hours but only 15-18 hours count toward your specialization).

## ",google+
I don't see all of the courses required for my specialization!," As this program is new, courses are being added in each semester. Not all
specializations can be completed in of Fall 2015. But with the inclusion of
Big Data for Health and Reinforcement Learning for the Machine Learning
specialization, all specializations can now be completed. Since the courses
required to fulfill a specialization are only a portion of the required number
of courses, take whatever courses look interesting until additional
specialization courses become available.

## ",google+
"If you pass more than the required core courses of a specialization, do
they count as ""electives"" or are they just ""normal"" points that count towards
your degree?"," They are just ""normal"" points that count towards your degree. . So if it
says ""select 2 from this list"" you have to do that. However, for any
additional ""free electives"", you can take any course you want, including more
from the specialization.

In other words, once you take the minimum courses you must take the required
minimum course  count as described in the specialization, then you can take
any other course to fill up the remaining 30 hours, whether they're core,
specialization-related electives, or from another specialization entirely.

Let's take Computing Systems as an example:

  * To complete it (30 pts), you would need:
  * the CCA class is required in all cases (3 pts)
  * two courses from the ""Core Courses"" list (6 pts)
  * three courses from the ""Electives"" list (9 pts)
  * four courses from the full OMSCS offering, including the core and elective list of the Computing System specialization (12 pts)
  * ""Core Courses"" do not count as ""Electives"" and vice versa.

Can I declare multiple specializations?," According to previous posts on the Google+ group, you must choose one and

 What if I choose to sit out the spring term of the OMSCS program?,"Scenario 1:

I took a course (or courses) in Fall 2014 and do not want to take a class in
Spring 2015.  What do I do?

Answer -- You don't need to do anything other than do not sign up for a
course.  You must take a course in Summer 2015 to continue in the program.  If
you sit out TWO consecutive terms (Spring and Summer), you will have to
reapply for admission and there is no guarantee you will be readmitted.

Scenario 2:

I started taking a course (or courses) in Fall 2014 and I withdrew from
school. I do not want to take a class in Spring 2015. What do I do? (this
scenario applies if you totally withdrew from all courses)

Answer -- same answer as Scenario 1.

Scenario 3:

This is my first term in the program, but I'd like to delay start until next
term.

Answer  -- You'll have to reapply for admission if you do not register for
your first term.

degree in computer science or related field (typically mathematics, computer
engineering or electrical engineering) from an accredited institution with a
cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher. Applicants who do not meet these criteria
will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis; significant professional or other
work experience with supporting recommendations may qualify as an adequate
substitute for the appropriate academic credentials, however work experience
will not take the place of an undergraduate degree. Georgia Tech will not
admit applicants into the OMS CS degree program without the minimum
qualifications for success. The Georgia Tech minimum criteria used in
determining each applicant's eligibility for consideration shall include:

Evidence of award of a bachelor's degree or its equivalent (prior to
matriculation) from a recognized institution, demonstrated academic
excellence, and evidence of preparation in their chosen field sufficient to
ensure successful graduate study; and

For international applicants, satisfactory scores on the Test of English as a
Foreign Language (TOEFL).",official-omscs
"I don't have the academic credentials for full admission now, but I would like to work toward that. What advice do you have?","The best advice is to take (and pass) courses in computer science from an
accredited institution. If you don't have a computing background, passing
these courses will present its own challenges and give you a preview of what
the OMS CS curriculum will be like. If you have a computing background (either
academically or professionally) and just need to plug a few holes, such
courses are a great way to do it. All applicants to the OMS CS or other

minimum criteria**.",official-omscs
"If I meet the admission criteria, am I automatically admitted?","No applicant is automatically admitted.  All applications are reviewed by a
faculty committee to ensure that those admitted can succeed in the program.
Applicants who are selected for admission will be conditionally admitted into
the degree program and must pass their first two OMS CS foundational courses
with a grade of B or better to be fully admitted. Students do not need to take
these foundational courses before registering for elective courses, however we
recommend students take at least one foundational course per semester in which

course personnel, including the instructor of record.",official-omscs
How many courses may I take at a time?,"Students may take only up to two courses until they pass their foundational
requirement. Once fully admitted, the maximum number of hours a student may
take is nine hours a semester (three courses). **Be advised that each course
is just as rigorous as its on-campus equivalent.** We recommend that OMS CS
degree-seeking students working full-time while taking courses enroll in no
more than two courses simultaneously.",official-omscs
"How much time can I expect to spend on reading, course assignments, etc.?","This is difficult to estimate, since all students have different learning
styles. A general rule is three hours a week per credit hour, in addition to
viewing the course videos. Therefore someone taking two courses at three
credit hours each can expect to spend roughly 18 hours per week on coursework.",official-omscs
Will I be required to purchase textbooks?,"Possibly. We anticipate most course materials will be provided free of charge
online, however some courses may require additional purchases for materials.",official-omscs
How does the student workload compare to a residential degree? How many hours a week will students spend on it?,"The total workload is the same as the residential program. The weekly or
hourly workload depends on how quickly students wish to complete the program.",official-omscs
How long does it take to complete and receive a degree?,"We anticipate the typical time for students to complete the OMS CS will be
about three years, though we will allow for longer enrollments--up to six
years--for those students who need greater flexibility.",official-omscs
How will you guarantee academic honesty?,"All exams are proctored using national proctoring standards. We have access to
4,500 physical proctoring facilities and are working with online proctoring
institutions.",official-omscs
How do I locate a proctoring facility?,"All proctoring is currently being done online. We continue to explore other
options.",official-omscs
"How will you handle grading? Will each student be evaluated individually by a human being, or is there an automated process?","Grading will be the privilege and responsibility of Georgia Tech's
instructors. We will leverage MOOC technology to automate aspects of the
grading process, using a significant portion of the tuition fee to support the
scaling of student evaluation through such technologies. Similar techniques
already are in use at Georgia Tech to handle grading in classes with very
large enrollments.",official-omscs
May I work full-time while enrolled in OMS CS degree program?,"Yes. OMS CS is designed to be flexible enough to accommodate the work/life
situations of many types of students.",official-omscs
Can I qualify for Optional Practical Training (OPT) if I complete the program?,"No. International students applying to OMS will not be offered visas, hence
they will not qualify for OPT.",official-omscs
"What are the expectations for enrollment, ****coursework**** and performance beyond the pilot cohort?**** ","Admitted degree-seeking students are expected to continue making progress
through the program and can take up to 9 hours in a given semester. OMS CS
staff and faculty recommend a maximum of 6 hours per semester for students who
are also working full time.",official-omscs
"Will there be a graduation ceremony? If so, are we required to attend?","As of Spring 2016, OMS students are participating in the Graduate Commencement
Ceremony that is held on campus for Fall and Spring graduates. Participation
is not required but is welcomed.",official-omscs
How will this degree appear on my diploma and/or transcript?,"The name ""Online Master of Science"" is an informal designation to help both
Georgia Tech and prospective students distinguish the delivery method of the
OMS program from our on-campus degree. The degree name in both cases is Master
of Science in Computer Science.

#### Cost and Transfer Credit",official-omscs
How much does the degree program cost?,"Exact cost will depend on how quickly students complete the program. We
anticipate that working students will take an average of two courses per term,
resulting in a total program cost of about $6,600 over five terms. Students
who complete their programs more quickly will pay less; those who take longer
will pay more.",official-omscs
Am I eligible to receive financial aid for OMS CS?,"Yes. All federal financial aid benefits and restrictions apply to enrolled OMS
CS students. Federal aid enrollment requirements apply.",official-omscs
What is the payment schedule for the program?,"For all program costs and schedules, please see the [Program
Information](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/program/) page.",official-omscs
I'm an international student currently enrolled at another U.S. program. May I be granted an I-20 to leave my current program and apply to OMS CS?,"No. Georgia Tech will not support visas for OMS CS students. International
students do not require U.S. residency to enroll in OMS CS.",official-omscs
I'm enrolled in a master's program at another university. May I transfer to OMS CS?,"Graduate students may not ""transfer"" to Georgia Tech in the same manner that
undergraduates can transfer; however, you are free to apply to the OMS
program. The Institute limits the number of M.S. transfer credits to six
hours, subject to the approval of the College of Computing.",official-omscs
I'm enrolled in a Georgia Tech M.S. program. May I transfer to OMS CS?,"You must reapply for admission to OMS CS and meet all program requirements.

#### Why the OMS CS?",official-omscs
Why is Georgia Tech doing this?,"Georgia Tech in general, and the College of Computing in particular, are
committed to fully incorporating disruptive educational technologies into the
value the Institute provides to its stakeholders. The development of massive-
online educational models bring an unprecedented opportunity to extend access
to high-quality education to an exponentially larger number of people, from
around the world, than we can accommodate on a physical campus. Our
educational mission as a public university is to explore and maximize such
opportunities.",official-omscs
What's new about this approach?,"It will be the first professional Online Master of Science degree in computer
science that can be earned completely through the ""massive online"" format. It
shows how leaders from MOOC, industry and academia can join to offer an
advanced degree program on a massive and affordable scale. We believe this
program can establish corporate acceptance of high-quality and 100 percent
online degrees as being on par with degrees received in traditional on-campus
settings, and serve as a blueprint for helping the United States address the
shortage of people with advanced computer science and other STEM skills.",official-omscs
Why ****computer**** science?,"There are an estimated 3 million open technology positions in the job market
today. Training skilled computing professionals is a societal need, and that
is a challenge Georgia Tech, Udacity and AT&T want to address.",official-omscs
How does computer science lend itself to evaluation using the massive-online approach?,"Often computer science problems have a right or wrong answer and lend
themselves to objective, rather than subjective, assessment and evaluation.
This is what makes computer science amenable to the MOOC platform. In
instances where this is not the case, we will apply the resources necessary to
evaluate and assess student performance.",official-omscs
Will Georgia Tech offer other degrees in this format?,Georgia Tech has no plans at this time to launch other massive-online degrees.,official-omscs
Why has AT&T decided to jump into the world of online higher education?,"AT&T believes the disruptive power of the MOOC (Massive Online Open Course)
platform can help address the shortage of engineers and other technical-
degreed talent in the United States. By making graduate degrees and
certifications available online at very affordable rates, Udacity, Georgia
Tech and AT&T are eliminating barriers for many students unable to afford or
access an advanced degree, and increasing the pipeline for the next generation
of technology leaders. STEM skills are essential across business segments in
today's digital economy.

will keep us busy for a while. However, we're always looking for new
opportunities to bring affordable, accessible education to a broader group of
people.",official-omscs
Is Udacity shifting away from its strategy of collaborating with corporations for skills-based classes?,"This is not at all a shift away, but a natural complement to the high tech,
industry skill courses Udacity builds together with not just AT&T but the
Googles, Autodesks, NVIDIAs of the world. Many of these companies are
employers of Georgia Tech alumni and look forward to seeing opportunities for
talent from both the degree program and from the more industry-focused
classes.",official-omscs
Why is AT&T the corporate collaborator for this initiative?,"As a premier global communications company and a champion for innovation in
education, AT&T will provide technology access, connectivity and products at
inception, as well as evolving service and platform support. The company will
serve on an advisory board and, where appropriate, offer corporate projects
for credit, be a source from which Georgia Tech draws curriculum content and

#### MOOCs, Education & Learning",official-omscs
What kind of evidence do you have to support positive educational outcomes for the MOOC delivery format?,"Udacity evolved the MOOC format into one for which the company has proven
learning outcomes and high retention rates. The evidence stems from an
independent study funded by the National Science Foundation, as well as
various smaller-scale evaluations. Still, Udacity believes the OMS CS enters
uncharted territory. Student outcomes are of utmost importance, and resources
will be dedicated to conducting independent evaluations of educational and
job-placement outcomes.",official-omscs
How do Udacity MOOCs differ from other platforms?,"Udacity MOOCs differentiate themselves in two significant ways. First, Udacity
courses focus on active student learning and student experience, by using
interactive and collaborative elements pervasively throughout our courses.
Second, Udacity provides human services in the form of student mentoring. In
past classes, we found that the Udacity formula can attain 100 percent
retention, compared to less than 4 percent for a conventional MOOC.",official-omscs
How much does it cost Udacity to produce a MOOC?,"While the actual cost remains to be seen and can vary from course to course,
Udacity typically budgets about $200,000 per class. Udacity is committed to
the highest quality of service, and OMS CS MOOCs will be developed by teams of
people, led by the Georgia Tech instructor.",official-omscs
Does Udacity own the MOOCs it produces?,"Udacity makes no claim with respect to the intellectual property of the
instructor or Georgia Tech.

#### The Need for STEM Education",official-omscs
Why do working professionals need this degree? Can't they just enroll in classes?,"The United States is facing a severe shortage of skilled workers in STEM
fields. The Georgia Tech master's degree in computer science represents an
achievement and skill set that companies like AT&T value and want more of
their employees to have. The OMS CS program will produce graduates on par with
those receiving degrees from an on-campus program, and will also bestow skills
certifications for employees who complete designated coursework and take
proctored exams.",official-omscs
Why does AT&T care about education and STEM-skills programs in particular?,"AT&T hires about 30,000 employees a year, and STEM skills are required across
its business. It's clear that the United States must develop a robust pipeline
of skilled STEM workers to remain globally competitive; many jobs are going
unfilled as candidates lack the necessary skills, training or degrees. STEM
jobs are projected to grow by 17 percent over the next six years, compared to
10 percent for other professions. Through this program, Georgia Tech will be
able to offer employers like AT&T a larger and more diverse pool of highly
qualified STEM-trained workers.",official-omscs
