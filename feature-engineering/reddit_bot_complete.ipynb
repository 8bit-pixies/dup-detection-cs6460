    "I'm an RF Spectrum Engineer currently working for a large defense contractor in the DMV area. While I enjoy the work that I do here, I've been thinking very seriously about a career switch to software development, with the intention of ultimately working for a startup or one of the resident tech juggernauts (Google, FB, etc.). I received a much more hardware-oriented degree in EE at the University of Maryland, with a very ehhh GPA (little better than 3.1). I've only recently graduated, and have worked at my current company for one summer as an intern, and as a full-time hire after graduation for a little over a year now (I'm doing well here and believe it wouldn't be hard to get work references)\n",
    "My software development experience is fairly narrow. I've taken a few classes in C and lower level HDL in undergrad, as well as completed a few of the Codeacademy courses in Python and Java (very beginner level, I know, just wanted to learn the syntax mainly).\n",
    "In my work, I've picked up Excel VBA and used it to build a number of ad-hoc engineering tools, as well as a bit of Python script to manipulate geographic data in QGIS.\n",
    "In order to build a portfolio for myself and increase the chances I'm hired at a large private tech firm, I've been considering four options: Traditional Masters in Comp. Sci, OMSCS in Comp Sci (GA Tech or other), MOOC, or programming bootcamp.\n",
    "Do I stand a chance at admission to GA Tech's OMSCS program? Would it be worth it to complete one of Udacity's nanodegrees first, to increase my odds? If I don't stand a chance either way, which of these other options do you think is my best bet to break into this field?\n",
    "The option I'm probably considering the least right now is the traditional Masters degree route, seeing as my GPA isn't great, I don't have an undergrad in CS, and of course, the much greater cost of a traditional degree (would it be worth it to pay that much more for a degree from a lesser school? I'm fairly sure my GPA would prohibit me from admission to a graduate degree at my own alma mater)\n",
    "Thanks in advance!\"\"\""
